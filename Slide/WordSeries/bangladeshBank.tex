\section{History}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{History}
\begin{itemize}
\item After the Independence War and the eventual independence of Bangladesh, the Government of Bangladesh reorganized the \textbf{Dhaka branch} of the \textbf{State Bank of Pakistan} as the central bank of the country, naming it \textbf{Bangladesh Bank}.
\item This \textbf{re-organization} was done pursuant to \textbf{Bangladesh Bank Order, 1972}, and the Bangladesh Bank came into existence.
\item The \textbf{1972} Mujib government pursued a pro-socialist agenda. In 1972, the government decided to \textbf{nationalize} all banks to \textbf{channel funds} to the public sector and to prioritize credit to those sectors that sought to \textbf{reconstruct} the \textbf{war-torn country} â€“ mainly \textbf{industry} and \textbf{agriculture}.
\item In \textbf{1982}, the first reform program was initiated, wherein the government \textbf{denationalised two of the six} nationalised commercial banks and permitted private local banks to compete in the banking sector.
\item In \textbf{1986}, a \textbf{National Commission on Money, Banking and Credit} was appointed to deal with the problems of the banking sector, and a number of steps were taken for the recovery targets for the nationalised commercial banks and development financial institutions and prohibiting \textbf{defaulters} from getting new loans.
