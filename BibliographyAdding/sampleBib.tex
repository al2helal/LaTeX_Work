This is a sample tutorial for showing how to add a reference in a file using \LaTeX{} easily.

In cisco press document of November, 2004 they show some network design tecnique with respect to QoS.

Now, I want to add the document reference. Then, I have to load package \textit{cite} using command \textit{usepackage\{cite\}} in the preamble(before \textit{\textbackslash begin\{document\}}). And make a file called \textit{bibliography} in the same location. Add your reference in biblatex style as following in the file.
\begin{verbatim}
@report{CiscoPressNovember2004,
  author      = "Szigeti, T. Hattingh, C.",
  institution = "Cisco",
  publisher   = "Cisco Press",
  date        = "2014-11",
  title       = "End-to-End {QoS} Network Design: Quality of Service in {LAN}s, {WAN}s",
  type        = "techreport",
}
\end{verbatim}
You can find bibtex file for your title in \url{https://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/}
Then use the reference keyword in your document as parameter in \textit{cite\{keyword\}} command. Here, the \textit{keyword} is \textit{CiscoPressNovember2004}.

For this case, In cisco press document of November, 2004\cite{CiscoPressNovember2004} they show some network design tecnique with respect to QoS.
Then add two line \textit{bibliographystyle\{plain\}} and \textit{bibliography\{bibliography\}} before the \textit{\textbackslash end\{document\}}
Finally, you have to run your file as follows - 
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex filename.tex
bibtex filename.aux
pdflatex filename.tex
pdflatex filename.tex
\end{verbatim}
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{bibliography}
\end{document}
