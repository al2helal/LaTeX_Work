  \opening{Dear Sir}

  I am writing to apply for the post of teacher advertised as poster.

  As you will see from my enclosed CV I am currently a third year student in CSE department of University of Dhaka with having about one year experience as tutor.

  I am committed to pursuing a career in computer science and engineering and am currently studying for further professional qualifications. I am particulary interested in your post as it would enable me to gain experience of working in a coaching with the opportunities for developing communication skills that this brings. In addition to my skills and experience as a student, I would bring to the post a proven ability to deal successfully and tactfully with students.

  I look forward to hearing from you.
  \closing{Yours faithfully}
