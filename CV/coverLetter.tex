  \opening{Dear Sir}

  I am writing to apply for the post of senior accounts clerk advertised in the Cambridge Evening News of 17 January.

  As you will see from my enclosed CV I am currently a third year student in CSE department of University of Dhaka.

  I am committed to pursuing a career in computer science and engineering and am currently studying for further professional qualifications by distance learning. I am particulary interested in your post as it would enable me to gain experience of working in a larger company with the opportunities for professional training and development that this brings. In addition to my skills and experience as a student, I would bring to the post a proven ability to deal successfully and taclfully with customers and clients.

  I am available for interview for the next three weeks.

  I look forward to hearing from you.
